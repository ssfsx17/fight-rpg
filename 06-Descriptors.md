# Descriptors

Descriptors have no effect on fighting. Examples of descriptors are presented here solely for creative inspiration.

----

**Absurdly Wealthy** - You own a house that has a garage, driveway, front yard, and back yard. You also bought your car new rather than used. This descriptor could be more rare than all of the other descriptors *combined*. The GM should make sure that fighters with this descriptor have a more difficult time relating to rational sentient beings than the aliens, bio-androids, transformers, vampires, etc.

**Alien** - You are an alien, and look visibly different from humans. You may also have unusual abilities such as stretching limbs, lasers coming out of your eyes, or the ability to completely bend over backwards.

**Beast** - You are a sentient animal. This presents considerable difficulty for communicating with humans and using their technology.

**Bio-Android** - You have an internal power plant that ensures that you never tire or need to sleep. You can also detach your limbs to expose energy cannons.

**Clone** - You are genetically engineered, and one of many. Other clones similar to you may also be fighters, and may even be hunting you down.

**Dark Element** - Your hair is purple or black, and you have purple or red eyes. You cause a zone of low light everywhere you go. Your complex actions cause supernatural power to come out of your own shadow.

**Earth Element** - You can turn your skin into stone. Your blocks may cause stone sheaths to appear around your arms and legs. Your damage against opponents also creates dust and pebbles.

**Electric Element** - You can transmit electricity through conductive materials. Your damage against opponents also shocks them and makes their hair stand up.

**Elf** - You are thousands of years old, yet still appear as fair and beautiful as your young adulthood. You also have long pointed ears.

**Fire Element** - You can set things on fire, just by touching them. Your damage against opponents also leaves burn marks and scorches clothing.

**Ice Element** - Your breath is constantly chilly, and you can freeze water just by touching it. Your blocks create ice around yourself. Your damage against opponents also leaves snow on their bodies.

**Last Master** - You are the last practitioner of your martial arts style left in the whole universe. Either that, or the only other practitioners killed your master and are hunting you down.

**Light Element** - You have blonde or silver hair, and shining eyes. You cause a zone of bright light everywhere you go. Your complex actions cause supernatural power to come from the sky.

**Metal Element** - You can turn your skin into metal. Your damage against opponents tends to involve parts of your body that one would normally not want to hit with, such as your pinky.

**Transforming** - When you fight, you change in some way. This can look like shouting a catchphrase, raising a weapon to the sky, putting on armor, performing a magical dance, changing clothes, bursting your shirt from muscle growth, making your hair stand up straight, shifting the colors of your entire body, or any other transformation.

**Undead** - You are a zombie or skeleton. This causes you to hunger for the life force of the living.

**Vampire** - You must drink blood to survive. You are also weak to sunlight, so must contrive methods of staying in the dark whenever you fight.

**Water Element** - You are constantly wet and dripping. Your damage against opponents makes them soaking wet.

**Wind Element** - Your hair and clothing are constantly blowing in the wind. Your grapples make the opponent fly very high into the air before falling down.
