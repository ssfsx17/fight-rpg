# Rules

Fight RPG revolves around fighting, as its name suggests. Fighting is the act of causing damage to others, or resisting and countering such.

The rules are focused on the fighting that occurs between empowered Fighters. Combat between one Fighter and one normal person will be extremely one-sided in favor of the Fighter. The extent of the one-sidedness depends on the power level that the GM has set for the game. At the lowest power level, a Fighter can punch one normal person more quickly than the normal could possibly react, although 4 or more normals who practice surrounding tactics could pose a threat. At the highest power level, a Fighter can obliterate a normal with a mere thought.

## Fighter Statistics

- **Damage** - This is what you want to cause to others, while taking less yourself. When a combatant has 10 or more damage, the combatant is defeated and removed from the fight. Therefore, the goal of a fight is usually to accumulate 10 damage dealt against each enemy.
- **Power Points** - These are used for **Magic** and **Super** actions.

## Tokens

Fighting involves the expenditure of **Tokens**. There are exactly six types of **Tokens**: Damage, Knockdown, Grapple, Move, Block, and Complex Action.

### Damage

Damage is the workhorse that defeats opponents. It is what you want opponents to receive 10 or more of.

1 Damage token can be spent to:

- Cause 1 damage to a target
- Combine with 1 Knockdown token to react to incoming damage. You still take the incoming damage, but you also cause 1 damage back.

Each Damage token that hits or is blocked also gives you 1 Power Point.

### Knockdown

Knockdown is important for controlling the pace and space of a fight. The more combatants in a fight, the more important Knockdown becomes.

1 Knockdown token can be spent to:

- Decrease a target's order by 1. In map combat, this also moves the target 5 feet in any direction of your choice.
- Combine with 1 Damage token to react to incoming damage. You still take the incoming damage, but you also cause 1 damage back.
- Combine with 1 Grapple and Move token to grab an opponent, causing 2 damage. This is unblockable. Since a Knockdown token was added, it also decreases the target's order by 1. In map combat, this also moves the target 10 feet in any direction of your choice.

Each Knockdown token that hits or is blocked also gives you 1 Power Point.

### Grapple

Grappling is valuable for being a way to deal damage that is unblockable. Keeping your opponents guessing whether you will hurt them with Damage or Grapple tokens is an important tactic.

1 Grapple token can be spent to:

- Cancel out a Grapple token being used on you.
- Combine with 1 Move token to grab an opponent, causing 2 damage. This is unblockable.
- Combine with 1 Move and 1 Knockdown to cause the above grab, as well as decrease the target's order by 1. In map combat, this also moves the target 10 feet in any direction of your choice.

Each Grapple token that causes damage also gives you 1 Power Point.

### Move

Move tokens are versatile, but less efficient than the others.

1 Move token can be spent to:

- Remove 1 Block token from a target.
- In map combat, move 5 feet.
- Combine with 1 Grapple token to grab an opponent, causing 2 damage. This is unblockable.
- Combine with 1 Grapple and 1 Knockdown to cause the above grab, as well as decrease the target's order by 1. In map combat, this also moves the target 10 feet in any direction of your choice.

2 Move tokens can be spent to:

- Cancel-out one action being used on you. This is useful for evading techniques that are unblockable.

### Block

Block tokens are the workhorse for keeping oneself alive.

1 Block token can be spent to:

- Cancel-out two Damage tokens, two Knockdown tokens, or one Damage and one Knockdown token being used against you. Each Block token that gets used up for such purposes gives you 1 Power Point.

### Complex Action

Complex Actions can be nice-to-haves for spending Power Points, or the foundation of general fighting strategy. Most techniques that require Complex Action tokens tend to also require the others. Complex Actions can be considered the special glue that binds a complete strategy.

1 Complex Action token can be spent to:

- Gain 2 Power Points.

## Fighting Procedure

### 1. Flexible Pool Phase

Each combatant rolls three dice. Each combatant's dice result is their quantity of Flexible Pool. They then allocate their Flexible Pool to the different types of tokens, with the maximum expenditure being determined by their attributes.

*Example: "The Dragon" has a Spirit of 4. This means that he can allocate 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of his Flexible Pool to Complex Action tokens during this phase.*

### 2. Order Phase

Combatants determine their action order from highest Flexible Pool results to lowest. In the case of a tie, the one who has the highest number showing on one die goes first. If that still results in a tie, then compare the second-highest die for each, and so on. If both combatants have the exact same rolls, then they roll five dice against each other to determine who goes first.

### 3. Action Phase

Each combatant acts in the order that was determined by the Order Phase. If it is their first Action Phase of the round, then they must declare their Flexible Pool allocation at this time. If they have no tokens remaining then they do nothing. Attacks, Grapples, and many types of Complex Actions will require a response by the target. After all combatants have acted, they go in order again, until all combatants have exhausted their tokens or have chosen to pass.

### 4. Status Phase

All status conditions perform their stated effects, then their durations are decreased by 1. If this results in a duration of 0, then the status is removed.

## Injuries

When a fighter is at 10 or more damage, they are defeated, and can no longer participate in the fight. But, player-fighters as well as those of the same or higher strength can take injuries to keep fighting. One injury removes 1 damage, but **reserves** one skill point. Flexible pool must be spent on that skill, but the injury prevents a token from being gained.

**Example:** "The Dragon" reaches 10 damage, and decides to take an injury to his Spirit skill. This decreases his damage to 9. However, he must now spend at least 1 Flexible Pool on his Spirit every round, and does not gain the first Complex Action token from such expenditure.

The limit on injuries taken on a skill is equal to that skill's number. For example, with a Spirit skill of 4, a fighter cannot take more than 4 injuries to Spirit.

## Chain Knockdowns

When a fighter is forcibly moved in a direction, they will also bump into the first thing in the path. If the forced movement results in hitting something, then both the moved fighter and the other object take 1 additional damage. This can also result in a domino effect or bowling pins effect, with a chain of objects knocking each other over and proliferating that 1 point of damage.

No fighter or object can take more than 1 damage a result of one incident of chain knockdowns, even if they end up being knocked into more than one other object during the incident.
