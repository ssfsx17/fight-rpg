# Equipment and Resources

Each type of **Equipment** reserves tokens. This means that if you are able to spend your Flexible Pool on those tokens then you must do so in order to continue using the equipment. Furthermore, the equipment eats the tokens during the Flexible Pool phase.

Each type of **Resource** can be used a maximum of 5 times per fight. A resource always requires 2 Complex Action tokens to use.

This makes equipment and resources seem to be disadvantageous compared to Complex Actions, except that you can trade, take, or sell them. Therefore, equipment and resources are quick ways to gain a capability that you need for only one fight.

Player-Characters start with the ability to hold two types of equipment or resources at a time.
