# Game Master Advice

Everything in this chapter is **advice** rather than **rules**. The rules themselves are likewise considered suggestions for a well-structured game of *Fight RPG*, but this chapter is even less strict. Players cannot demand that anything in this chapter be used in 100% of *Fight RPG* games in the world.

## Character Progression

### Gaining Ideals

Each fighter should take turns pushing themselves to gain more ideals. First, to fill out their North, East, West, and South ideals. Then, to add more ideals extending from those. The players' fighters should have roughly the same number of ideals, give or take one. If one fighter has 3 more ideals than another fighter, then that should be considered a problem.

The frequency at which ideals are gained depends on the type of campaign. One ideal per game session is a good rule to follow in order to flesh out the characters. With that type of schedule, it would take a number of game sessions equal to the number of players' fighters in order for everyone to have a chance at their next ideal.

The act of gaining an ideal must be meaningful. If it is driven by enemies, then the enemies for that game session should embody the opposite ideal, or a corrupted version of it. If it is driven by other fighters in the group, then the new ideal should be required in order to solve some problem.

### Getting Stronger

Every time a fighter gains an ideal, the GM can also hand out one **skill point**. The fighter uses the skill point to increase one of their skills in each of their three areas (fighting, debating, and creative) by 1. The fighter also records that the three skill increases were associated with the new ideal. The GM should enforce a rule that the highest skill cannot be more than 3 times higher than the lowest one. For example, if the lowest skill is at 2, then the highest skill cannot be higher than 6.

After each session, the GM can also hand out one **experience point** to all fighters. Experience points could be saved-up and spent to do the following:

| XP cost | Benefit |
| ---     | ---     |
| 3       | Learn a new Special Technique, and bind it to an Ideal
| 4       | Learn a new Magic Technique, and bind it to an Ideal
| 5       | Gain a new Equipment or Resource type, and bind it to an Ideal
| 6       | Learn a new Super Technique, and bind it to an Ideal
| 10      | Gain a Skill Point, and bind it to an Ideal

In order to help with the feeling of progression and getting stronger, the GM should not instantly escalate the power levels of enemies. Instead, weaker enemies should always be available, or it should take time for enemies to get stronger. Stronger enemies should also be available, so that fighters could look forward to getting strong enough to defeat those enemies.
