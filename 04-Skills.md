# Skills

New characters must assign numbers to skills in the areas of Fighting, Debating, and Searching. For each area, the character gets this array of numbers: 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2.

The skills in each area are:

- **Damage** - Maximum amount of Flexible Pool that can be allocated to Damage tokens during the Flexible Pool Phase.
- **Knockdown** - Maximum amount of Flexible Pool that can be allocated to Knockdown tokens during the Flexible Pool Phase.
- **Grapple** - Maximum amount of Flexible Pool that can be allocated to Grapple tokens during the Flexible Pool Phase.
- **Move** - Maximum amount of Flexible Pool that can be allocated to Move tokens during the Flexible Pool Phase.
- **Block** - Maximum amount of Flexible Pool that can be allocated to Block tokens during the Flexible Pool Phase.
- **Complex Actions** - Maximum amount of Flexible Pool that can be allocated to Complex Action tokens during the Flexible Pool Phase.

It can be inferred that very high skill numbers - or even having double the skill numbers of your opponent - do not guarantee success. They only provide the potential for success, and the flexibility to exploit weaknesses.

**Example:** "The Dragon" chooses his Fighting skills as follows:

| Skill           | Number |
| ---             | ---    |
| Damage          | 3
| Knockdown       | 3
| Grapple         | 2
| Move            | 2
| Block           | 4
| Complex Actions | 4

## Other Areas

The GM can write in any arbitrary areas for skills. For example, if the game world is written as being focused on large-scale warfare, then a War Strategy area may be added for skills. If the game world is written as being focused on politicking and scheming, then a Manipulation area may be added for skills, or the Debating area could be renamed to Manipulation. Anything that can be described as two entities trying to defeat each other can be encompassed within the game mechanics.
