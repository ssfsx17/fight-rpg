# Rules

Fight RPG revolves around fighting, as its name suggests. Fighting is the act of causing damage to others, or resisting and countering such.

The rules are focused on the fighting that occurs between empowered Fighters. Combat between one Fighter and one normal person will be extremely one-sided in favor of the Fighter. The extent of the one-sidedness depends on the power level that the GM has set for the game. At the lowest power level, a Fighter can punch one normal person more quickly than the normal could possibly react, although 4 or more normals who practice surrounding tactics could pose a threat. At the highest power level, a Fighter can obliterate a normal with a mere thought.

## Fighter Statistics

- **Damage** - This is what you want to cause to others, while taking less yourself. When a combatant has 10 or more damage, the combatant is defeated. Therefore, the goal of a fight is usually to accumulate 10 damage dealt against each enemy.
- **Power Points** - These are used for **Magic** and **Super** actions.

## Tokens

Fighting involves the expenditure of **Tokens**. There are exactly six types of **Tokens**: Damage, Knockdown, Grapple, Move, Block, and Complex Action.

### Damage

Damage is the workhorse that defeats opponents. It is what you want opponents to receive 10 or more of.

1 Damage token can be spent to:

- Cause 1 damage to a target
- Combine with 1 Knockdown token to react to incoming damage. You still take the incoming damage, but you also cause 1 damage back.

Each Damage token that hits or is blocked also gives you 1 Power Point.

### Knockdown

Knockdown is important for controlling the pace and space of a fight. The more combatants in a fight, the more important Knockdown becomes.

1 Knockdown token can be spent to:

- Decrease a target's order by 1. In map combat, this also moves the target 5 feet in any direction of your choice.

Each Knockdown token that hits or is blocked also gives you 1 Power Point.

### Grapple

Grappling is valuable for being a way to deal damage that is unblockable. Keeping your opponents guessing whether you will hurt them with Damage or Grapple tokens is an important tactic.

1 Grapple token can be spent to:

- Cancel out a Grapple token being used on you.
- Combine with 1 Move token to grab an opponent, causing 2 damage. This is unblockable.

Each Grapple token that causes damage also gives you 1 Power Point.

### Move

Move tokens are versatile, but less efficient than the others.

1 Move token can be spent to:

- Remove 1 Block token from a target.
- In map combat, move 5 feet.

2 Move tokens can be spent to:

- Cancel-out one action being used on you. This is useful for evading techniques that are unblockable.

### Block

Block tokens are the workhorse for keeping oneself alive.

1 Block token can be spent to:

- Cancel-out two Damage tokens, two Knockdown tokens, or one Damage and one Knockdown token being used against you. Each Block token that gets used up for such purposes gives you 1 Power Point.

### Complex Action

Complex Actions can be nice-to-haves for spending Power Points, or the foundation of general fighting strategy. Most techniques taht require Complex Action tokens tend to also require the others. Complex Actions can be considered the special glue that binds a complete strategy.

1 Complex Action token can be spent to:

- Gain 2 Power Points.

## Fighting Procedure

### 1. Flexible Pool Phase

Each combatant rolls three dice. Each combatant's dice result is their quantity of Flexible Pool. They then allocate their Flexible Pool to the different types of tokens, with the maximum expenditure being determined by their attributes.

*Example: "The Dragon" has a Spirit of 4. This means that he can allocate 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of his Flexible Pool to Complex Action tokens during this phase.*

### 2. Order Phase

Combatants determine their action order from highest Flexible Pool results to lowest. In the case of a tie, the one who has the highest number showing on one die goes first. If that still results in a tie, then compare the second-highest die for each, and so on. If both combatants have the exact same rolls, then they roll five dice against each other to determine who goes first.

### 3. Action Phase

Each combatant acts in the order that was determined by the Order Phase. If it is their first Action Phase of the round, then they must declare their Flexible Pool allocation at this time. If they have no tokens remaining then they do nothing. Attacks, Grapples, and many types of Complex Actions will require a response by the target. After all combatants have acted, they go in order again, until all combatants have exhausted their tokens or have chosen to pass.

### 4. Status Phase

All status conditions perform their stated effects, then their durations are decreased by 1. If this results in a duration of 0, then the status is removed.
