# Super Actions

Super Actions all cost 10 Power Points, in addition to their listed requirements.

There are references to "Maximum" versions of Super Actions. Maximum versions can be done through one of the following methods:
- Spend 30 Power Points rather than 10.
- Be at 3 health or less.
- Be in the Super Advanced state.

**Super Advanced Status** (1 Complex Action)

- You enter the Super Advanced Status for 4 status phases. When the Super Advanced Status counts down, it gives you 1 additional Damage token.
- If you do another Super Technique while in Super Advanced Status, then this instantly ends the Super Advanced Status, and you spend the costs of the other Super Technique normally. The other Super Technique will be performed in its Maximum version.
- You can use this technique immediately after any action that caused damage or knockdown.

**Super Chase Combo** (2 Complex Action)
