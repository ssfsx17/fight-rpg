# Player-Characters

## 1. Founding Ideal

The group as a whole makes a Founding Ideal. The Founding Ideal is what binds the group together and ensures that they all work towards one purpose. Perhaps the characters had shared experiences that resulted in the Founding Ideal. Perhaps they all independently gained it as their Founding Ideal, then met each other later.

Characters created after the Group Founding can come from a different Founding Ideal. But, in order to join the group, they must integrate the group's original Founding Ideal as part of their Improvement.

## 2. One Additional Ideal

Write an additional Ideal for the character. This will become the first of the Four Pillar Ideals for the character. This must be different from any other Ideals in the group, in order to ensure that the group has enough variety to be able to handle different situations.

## 3. Skills

Assign numbers to skills. For each area of Fighting Skills, Debating Skills, and Creative Skills, assign numbers as follows: 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2

This means that all characters have a baseline of usefulness, and have something to do during Fighting, Debating, and Creative scenes.

## 4. Descriptors

Choose Descriptors. Choosing no Descriptors is also an option. They have zero effect on fighting.

## 5. Equipment & Resources

Choose two pieces of Equipment / Resources.

## 6. Complex Actions

Choose four Complex Actions. For each Complex Action chosen, bind it to one of the character's Ideals.

## 7. Magic Actions

Choose two Magic Actions, and bind each one to one of the character's Ideals.

## 8. Super Action

Choose one Super Action, and bind it to one of the character's Ideals.
