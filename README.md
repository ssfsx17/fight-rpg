## Introduction

Fight RPG is a Pen & Paper role-playing game that revolves around the clashes between **Ideals**, and ultimately, the destiny of the entire universe. Every character in this game is a **Fighter** in some way.

The scope of the game has an extremely-wide possible range. On the minimal end, a Fighter is recognized as someone who can defeat five others in a fistfight, using skill and strength that no mortal could possess. On the maximal end, the most powerful Fighters in the universe can destroy whole planets. Fighters are only quantified in comparison to other Fighters, with normal mortals intentionally abstracted-away.

Fighters are those who have discovered or created a **Founding Ideal**. This process gives them supernatural abilities, above and beyond anything else that exists in their universe. Those who have ideals of avarice and conquest gain the power to oppress people in ways that the ultra-wealthy could not possibly accomplish. Those who have ideals of justice and equality will inevitably fight against the oppressors. All sorts of other conflicts between ideals are easily imagined.

## The Stakes of Fighting

Defeat is not equivalent to death. A combatatant who has taken 10 damage is almost never dead. Instead, death should be saved for special occasions.

The player-fighters are, in fact, encouraged to fight each other as part of planned training exercises. They may fight those who do not necessarily have opposite ideals just to size each other up. They may fight to the point of serious injuries in tournaments, but remain respectful of their opponents. Fighters tend to become more friendly and respectful with each other after a fight, unless they have opposite ideals.
