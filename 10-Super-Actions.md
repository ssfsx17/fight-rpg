**Super Advanced Status** (1 Complex Action)

- You enter the Super Advanced Status for 4 status phases. When the Super Advanced Status counts down, it gives you 1 additional Damage token.
- If you do another Super Technique while in Super Advanced Status, then this instantly ends the Super Advanced Status, and you spend the costs of the other Super Technique normally. The other Super Technique will be performed in its Maximum version.
- You can use this technique immediately after any action that caused damage or knockdown.

**Super Armor Status** (1 Complex Action)

- You enter the Super Armor Status for 4 status phases. When the Super Armor Status counts down, it gives you 1 additional Block token.
- While in Super Armor Status, you can spend 2 Block tokens to get the effect of spending 2 Block tokens, as well as perform a technique of your own. This means that against up to 4 damage, you could ignore it and immediately counterattack. Against 5 or more damage, you could accept a small amount of damage in order to deal out your own.
