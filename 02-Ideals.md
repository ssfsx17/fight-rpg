# Ideals

![Character Ideals Diagram Example](/Character_Ideals.png)

The narrative core of Fight RPG is the system of **Ideals**. Ideals are intended to feel like strong rules that players are constantly aware of, yet at the same time, not feel like any kind of separate game or metagame.

## Founding Ideals

Everyone who has gained the abilities of a **Fighter** has a **Founding Ideal**. The Founding Ideal becomes the center of one's being, and causes them to be supernaturally-drawn towards others with the same Founding Ideal. They are also supernaturally-drawn towards opposite Founding Ideals, resulting in conflict.

The player-characters all have the same Founding Ideal. It is this that binds them together and ensures that they work for a common purpose.

## Advanced Ideals

Fighters become more complex over time as they interact with other ideals. They eventually develop their **Four Pillar Ideals** and combinations of them. The Four Pillar Ideals represent the cardinal directions.

In order to join a group with a different Founding Ideal, a Fighter must integrate that group's ideal into their own set.
